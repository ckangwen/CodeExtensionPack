## [1.0.0] July 31, 2021
 - added new extensions
   - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - This is a configurable linter tool that identify and report on patterns in JS. Any problem this extension finds can be automatically fixed. The fixes are syntax-aware so there won’t be errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms.
   - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Who has a time formatting the code? Why not just press Ctrl+S and the Prettier will do all the magic. I am sounding like a salesman, but I really love how everything automatically aligns. Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
   - [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) - Writing arrow function expressions and pairing its brackets is sometimes a nightmare, especially if there is one in the other. No need for stressing about it, as this extension colors the pairing brackets.
   - [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) - The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code. With this extension, you will be able to categorize your annotations into: alerts, queries, TODOs, highlights or any other comment styles you’d like can be specified in the settings. Also, commented out code can also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn’t be there.
